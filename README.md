# EDA on Kidney Disease Dataset
## Introduction
- This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Kidney Disease dataset. The primary objective is to explore and understand the factors associated with kidney disease, identify patterns and correlations within the data, and provide insights that could help in early detection and treatment. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to contribute valuable information for healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers focused on kidney health.
